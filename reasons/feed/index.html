				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>That&#8217;s a pretty good reason to love my wife. She&#8217;s coming home today! In fact, right now, she&#8217;s somewhere over the ocean near Alaska. 35,000 feet above the earth, probably watching an in-flight movie or taking a half-nap. In four hours or so, I&#8217;ll see her walk (or more likely run) through SFO and into my arms.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m probably being a little over dramatic, but I&#8217;m excited. 40 days is a long time to be without someone with whom you&#8217;re used to spending every day.</p>
<p>Whenever people hear that she&#8217;s been gone for so long, they typically have had one of two reactions. They either say, &#8220;oh, that must be hard. Is this the longest you&#8217;ve been apart since you got married?&#8221; or &#8220;oh man &#8211; you&#8217;re a summer bachelor, are you enjoying that?&#8221; I won&#8217;t lie and say that the second answer has always been a no. There have been times over the past 40 days when the simplicity of being alone has been rather refreshing. I was able to focus on some personal things that I&#8217;ve been wanting to work on, and I think I took good advantage of the time. I think Kate would say the same thing, although I think she&#8217;s more glad that I had the time for myself, than that she had it for herself.</p>
<p>It was often odd to respond to the &#8220;oh, that must be hard&#8221; reaction. Of course it was difficult to adjust to a routine without Kate, and emotionally it was hard to not have her here with me like usual, but then I think of all the other circumstances by which our relationship could be tested and the past 40 days were anything but hard. Kakao talk (a Korean Messaging app) and FaceTime allowed us to talk and usually see each other every day. We exchanged emails and updates every morning and evening. I had this running blog to remind her how much I love her. Similarly, she had an Instagram photo printed for each day that she was gone, wrote a note on each, and I opened one each day before bed (yes, I know &#8211; we&#8217;re ridiculous). Of course nothing replaces a real hug or face to face conversation, but considering the distance, I think everything went pretty darn well. Kate definitely had a harder time than I did. She was in a foreign place, without very many friends or comforts around her, but she made it and thrived.</p>
<p>So, I usually responded, &#8220;yeah, it&#8217;s been a challenge, but overall it&#8217;s been a good thing for both of us.&#8221; In some ways I think Kate and I have gotten closer, or at least clarified what we value in our relationship. In absence, it&#8217;s easier to take stock of what is important to you, realize what you value about the other person, and see things that usually fall in the blind spots of daily life. It&#8217;s can be a valuable exercise to spend an extended amount of time apart from someone you&#8217;re crazy about. I guess, that it&#8217;s true that &#8220;absence makes the heart grow fonder&#8221; (cue: sappy music swells in the background).</p>
<p>All that said, I&#8217;m very glad she&#8217;s coming home today. The past 40 days have been challenging and valuable, but I&#8217;d of course much rather have her here by my side. And soon, she will be!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Kate was preparing for her trip to Korea, she was worried that she wouldn&#8217;t be very good in the Yonsei language program where she would be studying. She had convinced herself that she wasn&#8217;t good at learning languages. Sure, the way she processes information may not lend itself well to learning a language, but she clearly is more than capable of doing it. She learned a decent amount of Spanish in high school, became nearly fluent in Italian in college and over the course of the past year became basic conversationally fluent in Korean.</p>
<p>Regardless, she was nervous about the Yonsei program because it&#8217;s the &#8220;Middlebury of Korean Language&#8221;, the &#8220;Harvard of Asian Language study.&#8221; In other words, it&#8217;s one of the best, and it&#8217;s really hard. She was told that students who had taken through the fourth level of competing programs were often unable to pass the second level at Yonsei.</p>
<p>Well, Kate passed her program &#8211; with all A&#8217;s. That&#8217;s amazing! She&#8217;ll be quick to tell you that &#8216;it was the first level&#8217; or &#8216;a lot of it was review for her&#8217; but those things don&#8217;t matter and are only partially true. She tested into a certain level, then asked to move up to a higher level that was out of her comfort zone, so she was really in level 1.5 or something like that. It moved faster and went further in the book. Certainly some of it was review, but that is always the case with a language class, and is by design.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t wait to hear about all the things she learned and to hear her speak with her tutor here in the U.S. I think she&#8217;ll be very proud of Kate&#8217;s progress, as she should be. You see&#8230; my wife is super smart. Despite missing me soooo much, she was able to muster the energy to study hard and pass the hardest Korean language program in Korea. Go Kate!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is less of &#8216;reason&#8217; and more of a status update. Kate comes home on Friday &#8211; two more days! (or sleeps as Kate says). I&#8217;m so excited to see her.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve definitely missed her a lot over the past six weeks, but it&#8217;s intensified this past week. Maybe it&#8217;s the anticipation, or the amount of time that has passed. It could also be that I&#8217;ve had a lot of conversations with people lately that make me value and miss Kate even more. She&#8217;s so special to me and we&#8217;re such a good team.</p>
<p>I was more able to focus on my personal health and routines while she was gone, which has been nice. It distracted me from her absence and gave me renewed confidence in my ability to tackle those parts of my life. I&#8217;m grateful to have had that time, but I&#8217;m ready to have Kate back and to fit those new routines into my life with her. The next few months are going to be great &#8211; travel, visitors, my sister&#8217;s wedding. What an exciting time!</p>
<p>Friday can&#8217;t come too soon.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kate has a magnetic personality. People are naturally drawn to her. This is definitely related to a number of the other posts, but I&#8217;ve always admired this about Kate. Some people give off a welcoming, interesting, engaged vibe. I&#8217;m not exactly sure what it is, but everyone knows it when they see it and are naturally drawn to people who have it. Kate has it.</p>
<p>It could be her upbringing; southern hospitality, or her family&#8217;s midwestern sensibility, but I think it&#8217;s mostly just who she is. She&#8217;s warm, caring, curious and she listens with her whole self. I could analyze it by studying how she maintains eye contact, smiles, nods, verbally confirms, and maintains an open but committed stance in conversations, but those are all just technical details. The core of it is more personal and beautiful.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve long admired people with this ability and I&#8217;m so happy to have such a good model of it in my life. I constantly learn from her magnetism and hope that I can someday harvest just a bit of it so I can connect with people more deeply. To put it another way, in the 6 weeks Kate has been in Korea, I&#8217;d guess that no less than 5 new people now think of her as a close friend, and they wouldn&#8217;t be wrong.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kate and I are both close to our families. We both have incredible parents and siblings. In fact, I think it&#8217;s one of the biggest reasons that Kate and I work so well together. We have similar expectations, admiration, and ambitions for our families and our new family together.</p>
<p>We both love each other&#8217;s families like our own. A while back I wrote about Kate&#8217;s family as being another reason that I love Kate, but that goes the other way too. I love Kate because she loves my family. None of my other friends or ex-girlfriends were as comfortable, caring, and honest with my family.</p>
<p>My mom and Kate love to exchange healthy living tips and talk for hours about exercise, amazing recipes, and my mom&#8217;s health coaching practice. Kate will often spend an afternoon quizzing my dad about his work at the church, discussing religion, Asia, and current events. My sister and Kate are as close as biological sisters and text each other regularly to check-in. What more can I ask for?</p>
<p>Kate is definitely part of the Jewsbury family (but if you send her a letter, remember that she didn&#8217;t change her last name. It&#8217;s still Geurroch).</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve never been a big nicknames person. My family didn&#8217;t really have nicknames for each other and I can&#8217;t think of anyone that I&#8217;ve created a nickname for (other than maybe &#8220;Kate-uh&#8221; but that&#8217;s just the Korean pronunciation of Kate&#8217;s name, so doesn&#8217;t really count). However, I really enjoy the endearing nature of nicknames. Whenever Bob calls one of his daughters by their childhood nickname, I can see it momentarily transport them all back to those days. Their interactions become more familial and close when the nicknames are used.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s something I can practice, but I hope to get better at creating and using nicknames for people around me. Maybe some people find them impersonal and annoying, but I think they&#8217;re great.</p>

<p>A few days ago, Kate started reporting &#8220;9 sleeps until I see you!&#8221; It&#8217;s a nice reminder, and a fun twist on the usual, &#8220;9 more days.&#8221; Counting days can also be confusing because you never know if you should count the day it will happen or today in the number. Sleeps is unambiguous (unless you take a lot of naps). It&#8217;s also relative to different time-zones.</p>
<p>So, today, I have 6 sleeps until I see Kate! Kate only has 5 sleeps because she&#8217;s a time-traveler. :)</p>

I often will sit in the other room and listen to her mumble her alphabet or new vocabulary. It&#8217;s amazing to hear someone progress with something they&#8217;re practicing. So often a new skill is all internalized and can&#8217;t be noticed by outsiders, but it&#8217;s easy to hear the improvement when someone is speaking out loud every day.</p>
<p>Korean is very hard, and I&#8217;m continually impressed by Kate&#8217;s perseverance and by the progress that she&#8217;s made so far. Every time I hear a bit of her conversations with her teacher(all in Korean) or catch her interacting with someone in her hostel, I&#8217;m so proud and impressed.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kate makes great smoothies. I know it&#8217;s an odd thing to love about her, but they&#8217;re great. Who knew that spinach + peanut butter + banana + almond milk + coconut water would be so good? I haven&#8217;t had a smoothie since she left for Korea and I kinda miss them. Maybe I&#8217;ll make one this weekend, but it won&#8217;t be the same. :(</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been avoiding sugar and &#8220;white&#8221; foods lately as an experiment. Smoothies probably won&#8217;t fit with that plan. Fortunately, I have a cheat day every week and I&#8217;m going to make Kate make me smoothies all day long. Along with waffle, and french toast, and ham &amp; cheese sandwiches, and pasta, and mashed potatoes.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is day 30. I&#8217;m 30, Kate&#8217;s 30. That&#8217;s crazy.</p>
<p>In a few weeks, Kate and I will have been married for 5 years or 1/6th of our lifetimes. That&#8217;s crazy.</p>
<p>Kate and I started dating in 2006 when we were 21. That&#8217;s 9 years ago or almost 1/3rd of our lifetimes. That&#8217;s even more crazy.</p>
<p>Before we know it, we will have been together for over half of our lifetimes. Crazy! But so great. The best part about all this time is that every day holds new tiny moments together. Kate always surprises me, makes me smile and keeps things new (even from the other side of the world).</p>
<p>At our wedding, the best man (my friend Drew) gave a toast that finished with this: &#8220;Life is full of big events&#8230; and those are all great, but it&#8217;s the small moments that you&#8217;ll remember the most. On some Saturday afternoon, years from now, you two will be sitting on the couch doing absolutely nothing, and you&#8217;ll look at each other, and you&#8217;ll realize how lucky you are to spend your whole life with your best friend, and that <em>that</em> little moment, along with the million other little moments, is the best moment of your life.&#8221; He was and continues to be absolutely right.</p>

Once again, I win.</p>
<p>Kate knows her wine. She also appreciates all kinds of wine. This always makes going out for dinner or up to wine country a treat. Over the years I&#8217;ve learned a lot from her about wine and I too love the stuff. I can&#8217;t wait to go up to our favorite wineries when she&#8217;s home in less than two weeks! Especially Porter Creek Vineyards. We&#8217;re members there.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kate grew up in the south with very hot summers and relatively temperate winters. So, she prefers warmer weather. Living in Chicago was always a challenge for her in the winter months (aka 9 months of the year). Even here in San Francisco, most of the time it&#8217;s between 60 and 70 degrees which can often feel chilly.</p>
<p>How does Kate handle the cold? A wrap (or scarf) and a hat (usually a beret) nearly all the time. She has a few wraps of different weights and a black beret that she can be seen wearing nearly every cloudy day in San Francisco.</p>
<p>The wrap and hat have become part of her signature look (along with her big sunglasses). I&#8217;ll often be wearing no jacket at all, but she&#8217;ll still be wearing the wrap and hat. I sometimes laugh at her for it, but we both know it&#8217;s better that she&#8217;s warm. A cold Kate is not a happy Kate. :)</p>

<p>In Chicago, Kate and I really enjoyed making good cocktails. Aside from whiskey (obviously), gin was our next go to spirit. We discovered a local distillery (literally across the street from our apartment) called Letherbee that made amazing gin and it became our go-to. It&#8217;s seriously amazing. We don&#8217;t really drink many cocktails anymore, but I still miss easy access to Letherbee gin.</p>
<p>Gin, the game has been a part of our relationship for a long time. It&#8217;s one of Kate&#8217;s favorite games, and we&#8217;ve played it everywhere from our kitchen table to overnight trains in China. Kate usually beats me, but it&#8217;s still fun!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kate has been gone for 25 days now. Almost a month and there are still two more weeks to go (she shortened her trip a bit). There are a number of things I miss about having Kate home, but I think the thing I miss the most is long dinners.</p>
<p>Dinner together is pretty much a nightly ritual. It&#8217;s the only meal we usually get to share together, so we try to savor that time. We do sometimes watch a show (usually <em>West Wing</em>) while we eat dinner, but more often than not, we sit at the table, eat, and talk. Often that conversation can last an hour, two, sometimes longer. That&#8217;s what I miss most.</p>
<p>Those conversations can be anything from a laugh-fest, to a therapy session, to planning our next adventure or week. In all fairness, it can often mean that we neglect other work or tasks that we should be doing &#8211; but that&#8217;s a small price to pay for the wonderful conversations we have at the dinner table. Throw in a glass of wine and you have a perfect evening. I&#8217;m looking forward to a long dinner when Kate gets home.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kate and I have a 2013 Mini Cooper. We love it. In fact, I think Kate might love it a little too much. :) She&#8217;s constantly talking to it like it&#8217;s another member of the family and she&#8217;s told me multiple times while she&#8217;s been in Korea, &#8220;I miss Skiiinnn.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, what&#8217;s with that weird name? Long ago, before we actually bought our car, we would play a game whenever we saw a Mini Cooper. Kind of like punch-buggy, but with minis. We&#8217;d yell &#8220;Skinny Mini&#8221; and pinch the other person&#8217;s side. Silly, I know. It got pretty out of hand sometimes because it turns out Mini Coopers are pretty common in Chicago and San Francisco. So, Skinny Mini &gt;&gt; Skinny &gt;&gt; Skin &gt;&gt; Skiiinnn. (I mean, obviously.)</p>
<p>Skiiinnn misses Kate and is ready for her to come home.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kate has a very unique understanding of American pop culture. Growing up, she would rock out to Queen and Meatloaf in the car with her family, but had no idea about iconic shows like Seinfeld or The Simpsons. To this day, her knowledge of pop culture is (oddly) both deeply specific and patchy at best. Playing into yesterday&#8217;s post about honesty though, she&#8217;s always very willing to disclose her gaps of knowledge &#8211; often to the shock of the people she&#8217;s talking to.</p>
<p>The best example of this has to be one day when we were driving to Bloomington. I pulled out my iPod and put on &#8220;Sgt. Pepper&#8217;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&#8221; by <em>The Beatles. </em>After a few moments of the iconic opening track, Kate said, &#8220;Is this the new Modest Mouse CD?&#8221; I struggled not to crash the car. <em>To be fair, I had just played the new Modest Mouse album for her a few days earlier, so it was understandable for her to reference it, but&#8230;. it&#8217;s The Beatles!?</em></p>
<p>I have to admit, when we first met, her lack of music, film, and television knowledge confused me and sometimes bothered me (see above). There were times when I tried to talk about some classic album or episode with her and I received a blank face back. I always thought I would end up dating someone who shared my tastes and brought her own (similar) suggestions and recommendations to the conversation.</p>
<p>Over time though, I began to realize that Kate&#8217;s cultural tastes were more interesting than I gave her credit for in the beginning. In many ways, they were more interesting and eclectic than my own. She introduced me to her world of culture, and I&#8217;ve grown to love it. <em>(especially Queen and Meatloaf!)</em></p>

<p>A somewhat silly example of this is her willingness to admit when she doesn&#8217;t know something or understand what a conversation is about. Most people try to fein a level of understanding, but Kate doesn&#8217;t. She&#8217;s honest with everyone she encounters and it&#8217;s refreshing.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s also a very curious person so in those same conversations, she&#8217;ll take the time to listen and learn about the topic that she didn&#8217;t know about previously. I tend to just tune out after realizing it&#8217;s about something I don&#8217;t understand. I think I should try to be more like Kate.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve never met anyone who genuinely enjoys a huge kale salad as much as she does. Well, maybe the biker we observed while we were at Pie Ranch who stopped, bought a head of raw kale, then stood by his bike and ate the whole thing like it was ice cream. He probably likes kale more than she does, but he&#8217;s the only one.</p>
<p>Fortunately, her healthy eating habits have rubbed off on me. Since living with Kate, my diet has gotten considerably more balanced (and more tasty). It helps that Kate isn&#8217;t too much of a stickler and she enjoys potato chips and hot dogs just as much as me. She&#8217;s just really good about only doing that once in a while. &#8220;Everything in moderation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Very few things feel more like home than a nice dinner on the couch with a laptop in front of us playing the west wing episode. Then the next episode, and the next, and the next&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kate has amazing friends. Oddly, I&#8217;ve known a few of them longer than she has, but I&#8217;d still consider them originally &#8216;her friends&#8217;. In college, I met Kate because my roommates were friends with her. Then, I was introduced (or re-introduced) to her other circles of friends. They were so welcoming and fun to be with that I felt like I had won the jackpot &#8211; great girl, great new friends. Better yet, all of my friends (mostly my roommates) were already friends or at least acquaintances with most of her friends. It just worked.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure that had a huge impact on our relationship and it still does. Fortunately, we are still in touch with most of those friends to this day and now I consider them as much my friends as hers. She has a way of attracting great people to her and I&#8217;m fortunate to be able to piggy back on that. :) Hooray friends!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kate played basketball competitively in high school and dreamed of going on to play in college. Specifically, she dreamed of going to Harvard and playing for the Harvard women’s basketball team. Eventually, Kate came to believe that Harvard had no women’s basketball team and her dreams were shattered. (no, it had nothing to do with her abilities as a player &#8211; she could have done it, of course.) This led to funny stories and jokes about her childhood dreams.</p>
<p>However, the funny thing is … Harvard actually <b>does </b>have a women’s basketball team. They&#8217;ve had one since <a href="http://gocrimson.com/sports/wbkb/history/yearly.pdf">1974</a>. Unfortunately, broken dreams can’t be remade, but I think Kate’s pretty happy with the way things turned out anyways.</p>

Whether it&#8217;s a simple, &#8220;You&#8217;re amazing!&#8221; or &#8220;I&#8217;m so proud of you&#8221; it&#8217;s always heartfelt and sincere. She does this with me, her family, and her friends.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s always nice to get a little boost of confidence from the person I trust more than anyone. She&#8217;s usually pretty honest when I&#8217;m not so amazing or she&#8217;s not so proud of me, so I know she always means it. She definitely got this trait from her family who are all great at giving praise. I do think Kate takes it to another level though &#8211; in a good way.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if she realizes the influence her positive attitude has on those around her, but it&#8217;s definitely one of the many reasons I was drawn to her and keep falling more and more in love with her. She&#8217;s amazing!</p>

Her sister on the other hand will just walk around the wall. Kate is tenacious. She&#8217;s brave and relentless. This of course can lead to some frustration&#8230; :) but overall it&#8217;s a very positive thing. Despite all odds or &#8216;common&#8217; wisdom she will push on until she does what she needs/wants to do. It&#8217;s amazing to watch.</p>
<p>Now is a perfect example of this. In high school she was told she was not great at learning languages or similar tasks due to the way she learns, and that she should avoid it. Has that stopped her? No &#8211; she became conversationally fluent in Italian in college and is now successfully learning Korean! She&#8217;s amazing. Now I just need to figure out how to syphon off some of that tenaciousness for myself&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m not sure if Kate would describe herself as adventurous, but she really is. The best example is what she&#8217;s doing right now&#8230; She flew to the other side of the world by herself to study, meet new people, and do research. She&#8217;s done that many, many times and will continue to go to unknown, uncomfortable, and fascinating places.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say it&#8217;s easy for her. I think deep down, she&#8217;s actually a very careful, nervous person. It takes every ounce of her energy to go on these seemingly scary or unknown adventures. But, she knows it&#8217;s always worth it. She went to Italy by herself when she was 20 and made some of the best memories and friends of her life. She went to South Korea with a boy she had only been dating for a short time when she was 23 and it changed the course of her life in so many ways.</p>
<p>&#8220;What an adventure!&#8221; is inscribed on the inside of my wedding band. Kate picked the phrase and I was unaware of it until our wedding day. It&#8217;s a constant reminder that adventures are what life is for, and there&#8217;s no one I&#8217;d rather go on adventures with than Kate. When we&#8217;re not able to go on an adventure together, like now, the next best thing is supporting her through her own amazing adventures. She&#8217;s amazingly brave and I love it.</p>

<p>Fortunately (or unfortunately&#8230;) Kate is the same way. We both feel guilt for things that most people don&#8217;t even think twice about. This is good and bad, but it&#8217;s at least always nice to know that she understands when I say things like &#8220;I just feel badly about&#8230;&#8221; or &#8220;I feel like I should have&#8230;&#8221; Feeling guilty can lead to a lot of self doubt and inaction. Fortunately though, I think Kate and I typically make it a positive thing by focusing on how to avoid it, move past it, or use it to our advantage.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure where we both got it, but it&#8217;s always nice to have someone with whom to feel guilty.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kate wears her sunglasses pretty much all the time. We could be inside in a moderately lit store and she&#8217;ll still be wearing them. Two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>They&#8217;re prescription &#8211; so it&#8217;s easier for her to just wear them than change to normal glasses.</li>
<li>She likes to shield as much of her face from the sun as possible. (Did I mention her sunglasses are huge?).</li>
</ol>
<p>Her sunglasses have kind of become her trademark. She&#8217;s rarely without them. They make her look like a movie star&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kate and I are very lucky to both come from amazing families. Our parents are all still happily married and we have amazing siblings. I could chalk it up to &#8216;midwestern values&#8217; or something equally ambiguous, but the fact is, our families are all just great people. We are lucky.</p>
<p>I know the terms &#8216;mother-in-law&#8217; and &#8216;father-in-law&#8217; usually make people think of the &#8216;typical&#8217; overbearing, sometimes crazy, and often uninvited in-laws. Fortunately, my experience with in-laws is completely not that way. I enjoy spending time with Kate&#8217;s family as much as I enjoy my own. They&#8217;re kind, welcoming, and funny, and they&#8217;ve taken me in as a member of the family.</p>
<p>Kate&#8217;s sister is the lil sister I never had. Lil&#8217;mol and I joke that we have a tin-can connecting us because we have so many random things in common. Just the other day she messaged me to check in (knowing that Kate is away and I might be lonely). She&#8217;s a sweetheart.</p>
<p>I had no idea when I started dating Kate that her family was so great, but it only makes sense. Kate&#8217;s great, so why wouldn&#8217;t the people who are closest to her be great too?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m <strong>not</strong> a runner. Occasionally I&#8217;ll try to keep up with Kate, but it usually just ends with us jogging for a couple minutes, walking for five, jogging for a couple more minutes, walking for five. Kate on the other hand can run four, five, eight miles in single stretch workout without being sore the next day. She tries to run at least 3 times a week and feels &#8220;off&#8221; if she doesn&#8217;t. She&#8217;s been doing this since she was in high school. I can barely get myself to work out more than twice a week for 3 weeks in a row, let alone over a decade.</p>
<p>She definitely takes the &#8220;you only get one body&#8221; idea very seriously. In fact, she likes to say that we have to take care of our own bodies as if they were our partners&#8217;. If that&#8217;s true then I apologize Kate; I think I got the better end of that deal.</p>

<p>Anyways, Kate wears Leotards well. She&#8217;s sometimes mistaken for a ballerina. Considering her amazing posture (and the &#8216;onesies&#8217;), it makes sense. She&#8217;s beautiful, and her staple outfit is yet another reason why I love her.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are very few people I know who are more loyal and caring toward their friends and family than my Kate. She&#8217;s always the first to call, first to invite, and first to pick up the phone and say hi. We have a lot of friends spread all around the world and she keeps in touch with many of them on a weekly or monthly basis. It&#8217;s like she has a little bell in her head that goes off and reminds her to call or email people whenever it&#8217;s been a while, or whenever something important is going on in their life. (Granted, I know her secret &#8211; she always puts friends&#8217; important events in her calendar&#8230; but it&#8217;s still really admirable.) She&#8217;s uniquely loyal, and I love her for that.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m always amazed when I have a conversation with her about what she&#8217;s reading or researching for her PhD. I&#8217;ve never even heard of, nor understand many of the ideas she&#8217;s able to discuss with ease and poise. My wife is very much a smarty pants (in the best way possible).</p>

This isn’t an odd occurrence, we’ve been to Korea (and other parts of Asia) at least once every other year since 2008. This time is a little odd though, because I won’t be joining her for any part of the trip.</p>
<p>So, to belabor the fact that I’m a summer bachelor, I decided to write a note every day she’s gone with one reason why I love her. Necessary? no. Cheesy? kinda. A sweet gesture? sure. Mostly though, it’s a fun way to show my wife how special she is. So, here goes… (in no particular order)</p>
